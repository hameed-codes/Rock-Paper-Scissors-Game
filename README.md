# 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game that I built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to practice DOM manipulation and game logic.

The user enters their name, plays against the computer, and the scores are updated after every round. The game also shows a result overlay after each move.
